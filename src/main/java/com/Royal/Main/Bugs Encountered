I believe it's kind of late but I should write this

Problem: io.jsonwebtoken.PrematureJwtException
Possible Solutions:
    - ensure the expiration date and notBefore date are the same
    - Stop using old JWTs, the parser finds out that the JWT we are using has been created before
            even the application started. Login and use the current JWT. This fixed it
