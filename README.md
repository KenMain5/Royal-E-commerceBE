<h2>Description</h2>

This is the backend for Royal, an exclusive clothing store app. 

<h2>Biggest Takeaway</h2>
Through this project, I've significantly strengthened my Java foundations. Specifically, I've improved my ability to interpret API documentation and embraced the principle that methods should be minimal for easier testing and debugging. This realization was pivotal; it taught me that overly complex methods can be challenging to test and more prone to errors.

<br>Moreover, delving into Spring Security has deepened my understanding of how an HttpRequest traverses through the servlet container, transforms into an HttpServlet Request, passes through various filters, and interacts with the application. This has been enlightening in grasping the comprehensive flow of HTTP requests within a web application.
